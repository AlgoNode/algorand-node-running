# Running an Algorand Node

This guide explains how to run an Algorand node and why it's important for participating in the Algorand ecosystem.

## Why run a Node?

Generally blockchains that are more decentalised are more secure against malicious attacks.
As an investor or NFT artist, think of your node like your own little security guard helping to protect your assets - while keeping an eye out for everyone elses too!
If you're a developer, you can use your own infrastructure for your application instead of relying on third party nodes / APIs (which may incur additional costs).

## Getting Started

Firstly, you need to ensure that you meet the requirements of running a node.
A node requires resources that are available 24/7 such as power and internet.

If running within a home environment, it's recommended to have some level of protection against power outages such as a UPS (Battery) for your node and the network equipment (Routers/Switches) it connects to.
Ensure that your system has sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, Disk) and are actively monitoring it for faults.

If you're participating in concensus, you must not run a node on a device that is frequently going offline.
For example: Your personal laptop that may go to sleep or disconnects from the network when you roam.
