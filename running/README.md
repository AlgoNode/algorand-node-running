# Running an Algorand Node
This guide explains how to run an Algorand node and why it's important for participating in the Algorand ecosystem.

## Why Run a Node?

The Algorand blockchain is a decentralized network, meaning it doesn't rely on a single authority to validate transactions.
Instead, nodes distributed across the globe work together to secure the network.

By running a node, you contribute to this decentralization and gain several benefits:

## Getting Started

There are two main approaches to running an Algorand node:

Manual Installation: This method involves downloading the Algorand software and configuring it yourself. While offering more control, it requires technical expertise. Refer to the official Algorand documentation for detailed instructions: https://developer.algorand.org/

Docker: Docker provides a containerized environment for running the Algorand node. This simplifies the process and ensures consistency across different systems. Several tools like Algorand Sandbox and Algorand Node Manager can further streamline node management with Docker: https://developer.algorand.org/tutorials/exploring-the-algorand-sandbox/

Running a node requires ongoing disk space and bandwidth usage. Ensure your system has sufficient resources and are actively monitoring it.
